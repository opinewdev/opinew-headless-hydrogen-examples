This repository is usage example of Opinew headless widgets. It's based on Shopify Hydrogen example repository: [Hydrogen Examples](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen-examples).

## Opinew manual install

1. Make sure you have instaled [Opinew App](https://apps.shopify.com/photo-reviews) on your Shopify store. It's free.
2. Add the following code in page `<head>`

```
<link rel="preload" href="https://cdn.opinew.com/shop-widgets-components/v1/static/i18n/lang.json" as="fetch">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.opinew.com/shop-widgets-components/v1/static/css/index.css">
<script src="https://cdn.opinew.com/shop-widgets-components/v1/static/js/index.js" async ></script>
```

3. Insert widget tag in desired place in shop code

```
<opinew-plugin type="<WIDGET_TYPE>" product-id="<PRODUCT_ID>" domain="<SHOP_DOMAIN>.myshopify.com"></opinew-plugin>
